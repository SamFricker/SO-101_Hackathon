"""Tests for multi-file upload system fixes.

This test module validates the fixes for 4 critical bugs:
1. Directory path handling (uploader now enumerates files from directory)
2. Cloud path construction (uses actual filename, not trace_id)
3. Multi-file upload (all files uploaded before UPLOAD_COMPLETE)
4. External trace ID persistence (survives daemon restart)

Tests are organized by functionality, not by bug number.

        The Story:
            A video trace has finished recording. The recording data manager
            wrote 3 files to a trace directory: lossless.mp4 (100MB),
            lossy.mp4 (50MB), and trace.json (1MB). The state manager emits
            READY_FOR_UPLOAD with the directory path. The upload
            manager must enumerate all files and upload each one to cloud storage.

        The Flow:
            1. Create temp directory with 3 files: lossless.mp4, lossy.mp4, trace.json
            2. Emit READY_FOR_UPLOAD with directory path (not file path)

            6. Uploads: lossless.mp4, then lossy.mp4, then trace.json

        Why This Matters:
            Previously, the uploader tried to open the directory path as a file, causing
            IsADirectoryError. Video traces have multiple files (lossless for quality,
            lossy for streaming, JSON for metadata). All must be uploaded for a complete
            trace. Missing files means corrupted data in cloud storage.

        Key Assertions:
            - ResumableFileUploader called 3 times (once per file)

        The Story:
            We have two IDs: internal trace_id (daemon's UUID) and external_trace_id
            (backend's UUID). All backend API calls (update status, get upload URL)
            must use external_trace_id. Sending internal trace_id would result in
            404 errors or updates to wrong traces.

        The Flow:
            1. Create trace with internal trace_id="internal-abc-123"
            2. Registration returns external_trace_id="backend-xyz-789"
            3. Call _update_data_trace() with UPLOAD_STARTED status
            4. Verify API call uses "backend-xyz-789" in URL path

        Why This Matters:
            Backend doesn't know about daemon's internal IDs. If we send wrong ID:
            - 404 Not Found: trace doesn't exist
            - Wrong trace updated: data corruption in another user's recording
            - Orphan traces: backend has trace with no updates

        Key Assertions:
            - PUT /traces/{trace_id} uses "backend-xyz-789"
            - Never contains "internal-abc-123" in any API request
            - All 3 update calls (STARTED, periodic, COMPLETE) use same external ID

            must handle concurrent uploads efficiently without blocking
            or losing events. Race conditions could cause duplicate
            uploads or missed files.

        Key Assertions:
            - 5 UPLOAD_COMPLETE events emitted (one per trace)
            - All 5 unique trace IDs in completion events
            - No UPLOAD_FAILED events
            - Active uploads set properly managed (empty after completion)
